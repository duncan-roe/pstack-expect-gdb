.TH PSTACK 1 "Nov 19 2016" "Misc commands" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pstack \- print stack traces of running processes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pstack\f1 [-\f3rv\f1] \f2pid\f1 [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pstack\f1 uses \f3expect\f1 to run \f3gdb\f1 to attach to each process
named by the \f2pid\f1s on the command line, and output a backtrace for every
thread in that process.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reverse\fR
toggles frame output order (initially frame 1 last)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increases verbosity: shows interaction with \f3gdb\f1 if given once, and
\f3expect\f1 diagnostics if given again
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version and exit. \f3\-v\f1 only stands for \fB\-\-version\fR when it is
the sole argument
.SH SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
\f3pstack\f1 should run on any platform which has \f3expect\f1 and \f3gdb\f1
installed. So far, it is known to work on 32- and 64-bit Linux and Cygwin
systems.
.SH SEE ALSO
gdb(1), expect(1)
.SH BUGS
For some processes on Linux32 systems (e.g. Firefox), \f3gdb\f1's
\f2backtrace\f1 command shows all program addresses as 0xffffffff. But,
\f3gdb\f1's \f2thread\f1 command shows frame 0 with its actual address.
\f3pstack\f1 therefore always shows frame 0 as reported by \f2thread\f1.
This means the first line of each displayed stack dump has a \f2from\f1 in it
instead of an \f2at\f1.
